## Joana Chavez

Hello world and welcome to my repo, here I briefly describe in a general idea all the projects I have been working on or collaborating.

### Stuff I'm interested into:

Bioinformatics, Mobile development (Android mostly even though I developed an app for Blackberry when it was cool), Programming (C/C++, Java, Python, Akka, Scala, Go) and also another cool stuff like: SQL (and all its friends: SQLite, MySQL, PostreSQL), MongoDB, Docker, (Now currently learning Singularity) and also another stuff for networking like: ContikiOS and Cooja, Erbium and CoAP. We can grab a coffee and keep on talking about all the cool stuff I have done also during my courses in my Master's degree or at work. Another thing, I do not have time to renew licenses and I avoid hard to use interfaces, I believe in the KISS movement. 


```markdown
private void contactMe(String email){
  sendEmailTo(email);
}

if (theresAnyDoubt() || youGotACoolJobProposalForMe()){
    try{
      contactMe("jchavezlavalle@gmail.com");
    } 
    catch(Exception e){
      findMeAlsoOnLinkedIn();
    }  
}

```

Almost forgot.. I also speak Spanish since I am from Peru, English is my second language and I am currently finishing my studies in Italian. Arrivederci!
